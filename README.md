# SynaptiPi

**The official synergy engine bridging global ideas, solutions, 
and Pi-based collaboration to shape the future.**

## Overview
SynaptiPi is an innovative platform built on the Pi Network, 
designed to connect people, resources, and expertise from 
across the globe. By leveraging Pi-based transactions and 
collaborative features, we aim to foster a vibrant ecosystem 
where everyone can share knowledge, co-create solutions, 
and unlock new possibilities.

## Key Features
- **Pi Network Integration**: Seamless Pi-based login 
  and transactions using the Pi SDK.
- **Crowd Collaboration**: Community-driven brainstorming, 
  project submissions, and synergy mapping.
- **Micro-Incentives**: Reward participants with Pi 
  for contributing insights, solving tasks, or developing 
  proof-of-concepts.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built with modular components 
  to adapt and grow with the community’s needs.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: (Planned) React, Vue, or any framework of choice
- **Backend**: Node.js or Python (to be finalized)
- **Pi SDK**: For user authentication and Pi-based payments
- **Database**: (Planned) MongoDB or PostgreSQL
